// stacking level, so a caller applies EXACTLY ONE z utility on top (never two conflicting z-* classes
// on one element — Tailwind resolves same-property collisions by CSS source order, not class order,
// so stacking z-[110] and z-[250] would be a coin-flip). Motion-free (no pop-in) by contract.

// stacking): it and the workpane are side-by-side columns that never overlap, and its old desktop
// z-[100] is what forced every overlay to escalate past it — the recurring "hidden underneath the
// prompt box" bug. Anything below is an OVERLAY and therefore already outranks the rail:
//   z-20  fixed corner chrome · z-50 modal dialogs/drawers · z-[60] ⌘K palette · z-[70] toasts
//   z-[110] portaled selector surfaces · z-[200] shared Dialog · z-[250] anchored popovers/tooltips
//   z-[300] restart scrim (alone must cover the whole app)
// Never re-elevate a persistent layer to "win" a collision — raise the specific overlay instead.

// The selector-surface contract for Select, DropdownMenu, and the profile grid: the opaque base at
// z-[110]. Portal content mounts at document.body, so it must clear the modal surfaces it can be
// opened from (a selector inside a z-50 dialog) rather than paint beneath them.

// bug. This is the raise-the-specific-overlay fix, not a re-elevation of the z-[110] tier itself:
// it borrows the anchored-overlay level, which is defined to clear z-[200].

//    focus can NEVER land on a control behind the scrim (a native <button> fires its click on the
//    Space keyup, which no keydown guard sees — the only durable seal is to keep it unfocusable).
//    This covers portaled surfaces (Radix dialogs/menus) that live outside the inert app subtree too.
//  • Enter — a composer submit, belt-and-suspenders with the blur/focus move.
//  • ⌘/Ctrl + K/I — the global palette/doc chords (App.tsx), which would otherwise open surfaces
//    behind the scrim. NOT N: ⌘N is the browser's new-window shortcut and frizz no longer binds it,
//    so swallowing it here would hijack the browser for no gain.
// The rpc-layer mutation gate remains as a final backstop; between these, the "Frizz is restarting"
// red error is unreachable through ordinary interaction.

/**
 * Full-viewport blocking modal shown for the entire rebuild+reload window. Unlike the frosted
 * dialogs, this is a HARD block: it grays out the whole app, intercepts every pointer path through
 * its scrim, parks focus on itself and neutralizes the focus/activation keys — the user simply
 * cannot act until Frizz is ready, at which point App reloads this exact route. Sits at z-[300], above
 * ALL app chrome and every modal (the tallest of which — the shared Radix Dialog — is z-[200]).
 *
 * `stalled` is the one way out that is not "Frizz came back": past the hold's deadline the block is
 * lifted — no scrim, no focus trap, no key guard, App drops `inert` in step — and the card becomes a
 * dismissible notice pinned to the top, because the board underneath is dead and the operator needs
 * to read what to do, not be walled off from a page that can no longer do anything. Polling continues
 * behind it, so a board that does come back still reloads the page on its own.
